## Documentation Guidelines

### File Structure

- Place documentation files in `content/docs/en`
- Use kebab-case for file names: `server-first-dev.mdx`
- Organize related content in subdirectories
- Update `meta.json` files for navigation

### MDX Format

Documentation files use MDX (Markdown + JSX):

```mdx

   - Write for your audience (beginners to advanced)
   - Use simple language where possible
   - Break complex topics into digestible sections
   - Include code examples and screenshots

3. **Well-Structured**
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (h2, h3, h4)
   - Include a table of contents for long pages
   - Add cross-references to related pages
   - Use callouts for important notes

4. **Code Examples**
   - Provide complete, working examples
   - Include comments explaining key concepts
   - Follow Java and JSON best practices
   - Test your code before submitting

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add clear, descriptive commit message that follow conventional commits"
```

3. Push to your fork:

```

4. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

### Pull Request Guidelines

## Style Guide

### Markdown Styling

- Use `**bold**` for emphasis
- Use `*italic*` for slight emphasis

```java
public class ExamplePlugin {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Writing Style
